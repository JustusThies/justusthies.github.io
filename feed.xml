Justus obtained his PhD from the University of Erlangen Nuremberg. He is now a full Professor at the Technical University of Darmstadt where he is leading the 3D Graphics &amp; Vision group. In addition, he is an independent research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.<br />
Justus studies the capture and synthesis of digital humans. His work blends elements of computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning, with the end goal of capturing and re-synthesizing reality. Justus has done profound work on important aspects of “digital humans”, namely marker-less capture, neural synthesis, and multi-media forensics, among others. 
Justus’ Face2Face algorithm was a pioneering and very successful approach to real-time facial performance capture from video data which also enabled facial re-enactment. Later, with the advent of neural networks, Justus again considerably advanced the state of the art with his work on deferred neural rendering. Importantly, new methods for high-quality image and video, colloquially known as “deep fakes,” can also be abused, e.g. for misinformation. Justus and colleagues have made great strides on this equally important aspect in their work FaceForensics++, which allows to detect manipulated facial images. As the saying goes: “It takes (someone that makes) one to know one”, thus it is of paramount importance that researchers that develop new machine learning-based image synthesis approaches with all their great potential for computer graphics, additionally invest in identifying synthesized imagery. Justus’ groundbreaking work is a demonstration of this principle. 
The work of Justus Thies is published in the top tier conferences and journals of computer graphics and computer vision, and has been very widely cited, His work has been honored with a Research Highlight report of the Communication of the ACM 2019, and an emerging technology award at SIGGRAPH 2016.  With his considerable and impactful contributions to the field of digital humans, Justus helps shaping the future of how the real and the virtual interact.</p>

<p>EUROGRAPHICS is pleased to recognize Justus Thies with the 2024 Young Researcher Award in recognition of his outstanding contributions to Computer Graphics in the area of marker-less motion capture and synthesis.</p>

Specifically, based on textual inputs, HAAR produces 3D hairstyles that could be used as production-level assets in modern computer graphics engines. Current AI-based generative models take advantage of powerful 2D priors to reconstruct 3D content in the form of point clouds, meshes, or volumetric functions. However, by using the 2D priors, they are intrinsically limited to only recovering the visual parts. Highly occluded hair structures can not be reconstructed with those methods, and they only model the ‘‘outer shell’’, which is not ready to be used in physics-based rendering or simulation pipelines. In contrast, we propose a first text-guided generative method that uses 3D hair strands as an underlying representation. Leveraging 2D visual question-answering (VQA) systems, we automatically annotate synthetic hair models that are generated from a small set of artist-created hairstyles. This allows us to train a latent diffusion model that operates in a common hairstyle UV space. In qualitative and quantitative studies, we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model and compare it to existing hairstyle generation approaches.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Vanessa Sklyarova&quot;}</name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="reconstruction" /><category term="CVPR" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present HAAR, a new strand-based generative model for 3D human hairstyles.

While this challenge has attracted significant recent interest, existing methods either lack realism, produce unrealistic shapes, or do not support editing, such as modifications to the hairstyle. We argue that existing methods are limited because they employ a monolithic modeling approach, using a single representation for the head, face, hair, and accessories. Our observation is that the hair and face, for example, have very different structural qualities that benefit from different representations. Building on this insight, we generate avatars with a compositional model, in which the head, face, and upper body are represented with traditional 3D meshes, and the hair, clothing, and accessories with neural radiance fields (NeRF). The model-based mesh representation provides a strong geometric prior for the face region, improving realism while enabling editing of the person’s appearance. By using NeRFs to represent the remaining components, our method is able to model and synthesize parts with complex geometry and appearance, such as curly hair and fluffy scarves. Our novel system synthesizes these high-quality compositional avatars from text descriptions. Specifically, we generate a face image using text, fit a parametric shape model to it, and inpaint texture using diffusion models. Conditioned on the generated face, we sequentially generate style components such as hair or clothing using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with guidance from CLIPSeg segmentations. However, this alone is not sufficient to produce avatars with a high degree of realism. Consequently, we introduce a hierarchical approach to refine the non-face regions using a BLIP-based loss combined with SDS. The experimental results demonstrate that our method, Text-guided generation and Editing of Compositional Avatars (TECA), produces avatars that are more realistic than those of recent methods while being editable because of their compositional nature. For example, our TECA enables the seamless transfer of compositional features like hairstyles, scarves, and other accessories between avatars. This capability supports applications such as virtual try-on.</p>

To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads, including hair, ears, and finer-scale eye movements, we propose to couple speech signal with the latent space of neural parametric head models to create high-fidelity, temporally coherent motion sequences. We propose a new latent diffusion model for this task, operating in the expression space of neural parametric head models, to synthesize audio-driven realistic head sequences. In the absence of a dataset with corresponding NPHM expressions to audio, we optimize for these correspondences to produce a dataset of temporally-optimized NPHM expressions fit to audio-video recordings of people talking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a generative approach for realistic and high-quality motion synthesis of volumetric human heads, representing a significant advancement in the field of audio-driven 3D animation. Notably, our approach stands out in its ability to generate plausible motion sequences that can produce high-fidelity head animation coupled with the NPHM shape space. Our experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of FaceTalk, consistently achieving superior and visually natural motion, encompassing diverse facial expressions and styles, outperforming existing methods by 75% in perceptual user study evaluation.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Shivangi Aneja&quot;, &quot;website_link&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://niessnerlab.org/members/shivangi_aneja/profile.html&quot;}</name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="reconstruction" /><category term="CVPR" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce FaceTalk, a novel generative approach designed for synthesizing high-fidelity 3D motion sequences of talking human heads from input audio signal.

While recent volumetric head models, such as NPHMs, can now excel in representing high-fidelity head geometries, tracking and reconstruction heads from real-world single-view depth sequences remains very challenging, as the fitting to partial and noisy observations is underconstrained. To tackle these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-based prior to regularize volumetric head reconstruction and tracking. This prior-based regularizer effectively constrains the identity and expression codes to lie on the underlying latent manifold which represents plausible head shapes. To evaluate the effectiveness of the diffusion-based prior, we collect a dataset of monocular Kinect sequences consisting of various complex facial expression motions and rapid transitions. We compare our method to state-of-the-art tracking methods, and demonstrate improved head identity reconstruction as well as robust expression tracking.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Jiapeng Tang&quot;, &quot;website_link&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://tangjiapeng.github.io/&quot;}</name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="reconstruction" /><category term="CVPR" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce Diffusion Parametric Head Models (DPHMs), a generative model that enables robust volumetric head reconstruction and tracking from monocular depth sequences.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TeCH - Text-guided Reconstruction of Lifelike Clothed Humans</title><link href="https://justusthies.github.io/posts/tech/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TeCH - Text-guided Reconstruction of Lifelike Clothed Humans" /><published>2024-01-01T10:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-01-01T10:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://justusthies.github.io/posts/tech</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://justusthies.github.io/posts/tech/"><![CDATA[<p>Despite recent research advancements in reconstructing clothed humans from a single image, accurately restoring the “unseen regions” with high-level details remains an unsolved challenge that lacks attention. Existing methods often generate overly smooth back-side surfaces with a blurry texture. But how to effectively capture all visual attributes of an individual from a single image, which are sufficient to reconstruct unseen areas (e.g., the back view)? Motivated by the power of foundation models, TeCH reconstructs the 3D human by leveraging 1) descriptive text prompts (e.g., garments, colors, hairstyles) which are automatically generated via a garment parsing model and Visual Question Answering (VQA), 2) a personalized fine-tuned Text-to-Image diffusion model (T2I) which learns the “indescribable” appearance. To represent high-resolution 3D clothed humans at an affordable cost, we propose a hybrid 3D representation based on DMTet, which consists of an explicit body shape grid and an implicit distance field. Guided by the descriptive prompts + personalized T2I diffusion model, the geometry and texture of the 3D humans are optimized through multi-view Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and reconstruction losses based on the original observation. TeCH produces high-fidelity 3D clothed humans with consistent &amp; delicate texture, and detailed full-body geometry. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that TeCH outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality.</p>

Current photorealistic drivable avatars require either accurate 3D registrations during training, dense input images during testing, or both. The ones based on neural radiance fields also tend to be prohibitively slow for telepresence applications. This work uses the recently presented 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render realistic humans at real-time framerates, using dense calibrated multi-view videos as input. To deform those primitives, we depart from the commonly used point deformation method of linear blend skinning (LBS) and use a classic volumetric deformation method: cage deformations. Given their smaller size, we drive these deformations with joint angles and keypoints, which are more suitable for communication applications. Our experiments on nine subjects with varied body shapes, clothes, and motions obtain higher-quality results than state-of-the-art methods when using the same training and test data.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Wojciech Zielonka&quot;, &quot;website_link&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://zielon.github.io/&quot;}</name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="reconstruction" /><category term="ArXiv" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present Drivable 3D Gaussian Avatars (D3GA), the first 3D controllable model for human bodies rendered with Gaussian splats.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">360° Volumetric Portrait Avatar</title><link href="https://justusthies.github.io/posts/3VP/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="360° Volumetric Portrait Avatar" /><published>2024-01-01T07:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-01-01T07:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://justusthies.github.io/posts/3VP</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://justusthies.github.io/posts/3VP/"><![CDATA[<p>We propose 360° Volumetric Portrait (3VP) Avatar, a novel method for reconstructing 360° photo-realistic portrait avatars of human subjects solely based on monocular video inputs. State-of-the-art monocular avatar reconstruction methods rely on stable facial performance capturing. However, the common usage of 3DMM-based facial tracking has its limits; side-views can hardly be captured and it fails, especially, for back-views, as required inputs like facial landmarks or human parsing masks are missing. This results in incomplete avatar reconstructions that only cover the frontal hemisphere. In contrast to this, we propose a template-based tracking of the torso, head and facial expressions which allows us to cover the appearance of a human subject from all sides. Thus, given a sequence of a subject that is rotating in front of a single camera, we train a neural volumetric representation based on neural radiance fields. A key challenge to construct this representation is the modeling of appearance changes, especially, in the mouth region (i.e., lips and teeth). We, therefore, propose a deformation-field-based blend basis which allows us to interpolate between different appearance states. We evaluate our approach on captured real-world data and compare against state-of-the-art monocular reconstruction methods. In contrast to those, our method is the first monocular technique that reconstructs an entire 360° avatar.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;display_name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Jalees Nehvi&quot;}</name></author><category term="publication" /><category term="reconstruction" /><category term="ArXiv" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose 360° Volumetric Portrait (3VP) Avatar, a novel method for reconstructing 360° photo-realistic portrait avatars of human subjects solely based on monocular video inputs.]]></summary></entry></feed>
